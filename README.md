## 📊 Output Reports

### 🖥️ Infrastructure Report

* Exposed services
* Outdated software
* Crypto weaknesses
* Misconfigurations
* Legacy protocols
* Remote access exposure

**File:** `nmap_report.html`

---

### 🌐 Web Vulnerability Report

* CVE findings
* Template-based vulnerabilities
* Affected URLs
* Severity grouping
* Deduplicated results

**File:** `web_report.html`

---

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
sudo apt install nmap
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/cmd/katana@latest
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest
pip install dirsearch
pip install colorama
```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

### Help

```bash
python3 enum.py -h
```

### Scan single host

```bash
python3 enum.py 10.10.10.5
```

### Scan multiple targets

```bash
python3 enum.py -l targets.txt
```

### Parallel scanning

```bash
python3 enum.py -l targets.txt -t 10
```

### Resume scan

```bash
python3 enum.py -l targets.txt --resume
```

### Export Report

```bash
# path results/ directory and its subdir should have all the .nmap and nuclei.txt reports
 
python3 nmap2html.py -i results/ -o nmap_report.html
python3 nuclei2html.py -i results/ -o nuclei_report.html
```

## 🧠 URL Filtering Logic

**Keeps:**

* Status codes: `200`, `302`, `401`, `403`
* Parameterized endpoints
* Admin / login paths
* Dynamic application URLs

**Removes:**

* Static files (JS, CSS, images, fonts)
* Duplicate URLs
* Deep crawl noise

---

## ⚡ Performance Design

* Multi-threaded target execution
* Timeout protection for long tasks
* Stream-based processing (low RAM usage)
* Safe aggressive scan defaults

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool is intended **only for authorized internal penetration testing and security assessments.**
Do not use without proper permission.
